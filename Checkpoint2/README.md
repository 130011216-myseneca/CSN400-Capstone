<br />***PART B - Creating Local Repo with 'git status' and 'git log': How do these two commands differ? Elaborate with an example.***
\
<br />Git Status shows the staging area and status of the repository.
<br />Git Log shows this history of commits. 


<br />***PART C - Creating and merging branches: Run 'git log -n 5'. Embed the log output as bash script to the 'README.md' with proper formatting.***\
<br /> git log -n 5 >> README.md

****QUESTIONS**** 

<br />

***1. What are the differences between develop branch and main branch?***

The main branch is the default branch where everything that happens, eventually get's merged into. The development branch is where changes are made and will eventually be merged into the main branch.  It also allows an easier workflow for multiple users.

***2. What are the three supporting branches?***


The three branches are:
Features/Bugfix- Used for development of new features/Used to fix bugs and merges back into development.
Hotfix-Changes that have to happen immediately, branches from main branch.
Release-Used for release updates and last minute changes.

***3. What is the best practices working with release branches?***

There should be more then one developer and be 'publicly available'. This allows a smaller room for error.
