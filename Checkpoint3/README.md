**Take note:**

- You are not allowed to work from remote though browser or from local. You must use local repo in your laptop and azure.You can use any IDE of your choice, though the preferred option in this course is Microsoft VS Code.
- Build the habit of continuous, gradual and small updates with multiple `add` , `commit` , `push`. If a single commit has large volume of text and code added to your repository, it will raise the question of the source of the work. This exercise must have at least 6 commits.

## Blackboard Submission Instructions

You need to submit two files in Blackboard:

1. Your `README.md` file
2. A single pdf file with title `CP3-student number.pdf`. If your file is not `.pdf` I will not mark it

1. A link to your GitHub repository root folder
2. A link to your `Checkpoint3` folder that contains your `README.md` and other files
3. A screenshot of your `Checkpoint3/README.md` commit history folder
4. Details of your last commit number to `Checkpoint3/README.md`
5. Log record of your last commit from local repository using `git log -n 1` command

**Take note:**

- Your report file format and naming must follow above instruction, **no marks** will be given to submissions that do not follow the above instructions.
- Do not copy anything from the course notes or references in your submission. What you submit must be your authentic work, even if it is brief.
