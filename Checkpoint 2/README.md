QUESTIONS
1. What are the differences between develop branch and main branch?

The main branch is the default branch where everything that happens, eventually get's merged into. The development branch is where changes are made and will eventually be merged into the main branch.  It also allows an easier workflow for multiple users.

The three branches are:
Features/Bugfix- Used for development of new features/Used to fix bugs and merges back into development.
Hotfix-Changes that have to happen immediately, branches from main branch.
Release-Used for release updates and last minute changes.
